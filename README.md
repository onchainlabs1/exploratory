# 🚀 Exploratory Data Analysis Demonstration

## 📊 Dataset Description
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) demonstration using a dataset from the 🤗 Hugging Face Datasets Hub. The analysis focuses on the IMDB dataset, which consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative sentiment.

### 📌 Why This Dataset?
The IMDB dataset was chosen for this demonstration due to its relevance and popularity in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into the sentiment distribution of movie reviews and explore the characteristics of text data.

### 🛠️ How to Use This Repository
1. **Accessing the Notebook**: You can access the notebook containing the EDA demonstration on Google Colab by following [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iJLfyWj3fJ1Y8FYRmTbxL9Dpy3E42DnN?usp=sharing).

2. **Running the Notebook**: Once you open the notebook in Google Colab, you can execute each cell sequentially to perform the analysis. Make sure to run the cell that installs dependencies before proceeding with the analysis.

### 🔍 Analysis Overview
The EDA demonstration includes the following steps:

## Analysis Overview
The EDA demonstration includes the following steps:
1. Installing necessary dependencies for data analysis.
2. Loading the IMDB dataset using the Hugging Face Datasets library.
3. Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
4. Displaying the first few rows and basic statistical descriptions of the DataFrame.
5. Counting the number of positive and negative reviews.
6. Visualizing the distribution of sentiments using bar plots.
7. Adding a column for text length and visualizing the distribution of text lengths.
8. Checking for missing values and dropping duplicates from the DataFrame.
9. Plotting boxplots to compare text lengths by sentiment.
10. Generating word clouds for positive and negative reviews (optional but provides additional insights).

#### Word Cloud Analysis (Optional)
The notebook includes an optional analysis to generate word clouds for positive and negative reviews. This visualization helps in understanding the most frequent words in the reviews, excluding common stopwords. Note that this cell may take some time to execute.

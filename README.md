# Exploratory Data Analysis Demonstration

## Dataset Description:
ðŸš€ This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) demonstration using a dataset from the ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Datasets Hub. The analysis focuses on the IMDB dataset, which consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative sentiment.

### Why This Dataset?
The IMDB dataset was chosen for this demonstration due to its relevance and popularity in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into the sentiment distribution of movie reviews and explore the characteristics of text data.

### How to Use This Repository:
1. **Accessing the Notebook:** You can access the notebook containing the EDA demonstration on Google Colab by following [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iJLfyWj3fJ1Y8FYRmTbxL9Dpy3E42DnN?usp=sharing).

2. **Running the Notebook:** Once you open the notebook in Google Colab, you can execute each cell sequentially to perform the analysis. Make sure to run the cell that installs dependencies before proceeding with the analysis.

### Analysis Overview:
The EDA demonstration includes the following steps:

- Installing necessary dependencies for data analysis.
- Loading the IMDB dataset using the Hugging Face Datasets library.
- Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
- Displaying the first few rows and basic statistical descriptions of the DataFrame.
- Counting the number of positive and negative reviews.
- Visualizing the distribution of sentiments using bar plots.
- Adding a column for text length and visualizing the distribution of text lengths.
- Checking for missing values and dropping duplicates from the DataFrame.

### Sharing the Repository:
